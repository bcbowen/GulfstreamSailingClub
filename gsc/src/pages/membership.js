      <h2>Membership Information</h2>

      <p>
        Gulfstream Sailing Club is a boater's sailing club without the yacht
        club pretense.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to meet great people, have fun on boats and
        participate in a range of activities on the water and on land, then you
        need to join!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to learn how to sail we have members with years of on
        and off the water boat experience. Everyone is willing to offer "how to
        information" or chat about the best places to cruise or races to
        participate in. Better still, you don't have to own a boat to join. If
        you don't know how to sail or need a refresher course, we have a
        beautiful location in Hollywood where we run a small boat sailing
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        The club offers a steady diet of raft-ups, fun races, as well as
        cruising events and social activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership costs are $140 for new members/ family and $100 annual
        renewal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new members receive GSC nametags, by-laws, club roster and other fun
        items. One membership covers the whole family.
