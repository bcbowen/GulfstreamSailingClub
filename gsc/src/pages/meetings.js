      <h3>General Meetings</h3>
      <p>
        Meetings are held on the third Tuesday of each month. <br />
        Due to the recent pandemic, we have lost our previous regular meeting
        spot. Please check our Facebook site or email, or contact a current
        member for updates. General meeting minutes are published to this page.
      </p>

      <h3>Board Meetings</h3>
      <p>
        The Board meets on the first Monday of each month. Typically only board
        members and committee chairs are present but members may attend if they
        have something to bring before the board or are interested in the
        proceedings. Board meeting minutes are published to this page.
      </p>

      <h3>Happy Hour</h3>
      <p>
        Happy Hours happen on the second Tuesday of the month. They are open to
        anyone involved with or interested in the club, so it is a great place
        to come out and meet some members if you are interested in learning more
        about GSC.
        <br />
        We were previously holding Happy Hours every week except for the week of
        the General meeting, but this led to sparse and unpredictable
        attendance. The board decided it would be better to have a single Happy
        Hour each month, so everyone interested could attend at the same time.
        The event begins about 6:30 PM and the location is currently not set, as
        we are alternating between a few potential long term locations to
        determine the best fit. Please check with the FB page or contact the
        board for exact location of the upcoming event. Also we will send out a
        notification email to everyone on the list.
